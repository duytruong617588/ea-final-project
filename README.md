For the final project, we applied the Microservices Architecture, itâ€™s including:
-   Separate our monolithic to microservices.
-   Build the API gateway to manage the domain business.
-   Using configuration service to store all the settings of all services.
-   Separate database following the microservice architecture.
-   Build core to avoid duplicated code between service with service.
-   Using RappitMQ to push message for notification service.
-   Using FeignClient to communicate service with service.
